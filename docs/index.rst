Welcome to Modulo!
==================

Modulo is a framework for writing Python web applications by combining small prewritten snippets of code.

The code for Modulo is in semi-active development. You can get a copy by cloning the git repository::

    git clone git://www.ellipsix.net/modulo.git

or download the latest release from the website, http://www.ellipsix.net/devweb/modulo/index.html. All code included in either the repository or the direct download should be considered subject to the GNU GPL unless labeled otherwise. (It may be rereleased under a more permissive license soon, possibly the LGPL)

Patches and contributions are gladly accepted. If you submit a patch, I will contact you before making any decision regarding changing the license and you will have the opportunity to have your patch withdrawn from the software.

.. WARNING:: This is alpha-quality software!
    Please do not use it in a production environment, unless you run your own tests and can satisfy yourself that it meets your needs.

Documentation for Modulo is under construction and will be posted and updated as it becomes available. For now, you can take a look at the :doc:`tutorial` to get a sense of how the system works.
